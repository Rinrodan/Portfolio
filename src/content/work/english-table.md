This is a 19th century design by [Gustav Stickley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Stickley). 

I used Solidworks to interpret the very minimalistic instructions by Stickley, and ended up with a complete cut list for each piece. 

There is currently a couple hundred punds of rough cut lumber curing in my garage waiting for me to have some free time.
